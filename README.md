## 🧠 What I’m About

- 🎓 Wrapping up high school, 1 more year after this one
- 💻 Programming in C++ across SFML and Unreal Engine and Python for small scripts for personal use
- 🎮 Designing my own games from scratch — systems-first, gameplay-focused
- 🧪 Treating every project like a lab for testing mechanics, architecture, and optimization  
- 🕯️ Drawn to **horror**, **psychological tension**, and **survival** in gameplay  
- 🧩 Into structured code, clear naming, and keeping things **maintainable**  
- 🌒 Exploring Story progression, shaders, post process fx, and lighting visuals  
- 📚 Mixing code with storywriting, psychology, and game design theory

## 🎮 My Projects

### 🔫 SFML - ARENA
> A pixelated top-down game with progression, combinable upgrades, and responsive input.

- SFML-based rendering
- Shooting and weapon systems
- Save system with perks and permanent upgrades
- Increasing difficulty curve and enemy scaling
- Flashlight system using OpenGL lighting shaders

### 🌲 Unreal Engine - Behind the trees
> A 3D singleplayer experience blending twisted characters, horror, and a twisted story to unravel.

- Survival in a dark forest that never seems to see the sun
- Exploring different paths that somehow lead you back to where you started
- Characters that seem to turn mad - or is it yourself?
- Search for shelter as the forest tries to search for you

### 🐺 Unreal Engine - Werevolves
> A 3D multiplayer experience exploring the card game Werewolves in a digitally realikzed version.

- Multiplayer using Steam Sessions
- Connect with your friends to play the different roles of the classic 'Werewolves'
- Decide which of you is the impostor and who to trust when the night takes it's victims

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech I Use

- **Languages**: C++, Python, a bit of GLSL/HLSL, and Unreal Blueprints
- **Engines**: Unreal Engine (C++-oriented), SFML (2D rendering)
- **Systems I Build**: Inventory logic, custom GUIs, shader effects, story trees, post-processing shaders, Generalized Entity Systems
- **Methodology**: Clean architecture, debug-friendly patterns, and low-level performance awareness

---

## 📌 Current Goals

- 🎯 Release a demo for my horror game with story to be built off of
- ✍️ Finishing school projects, such as the SFML shooter mentioned above

---

## 💭 Random Bits

- I’m a night coder by nature 🌙  
- I don’t like over-engineering unless it’s justified  
- I spend as much time debugging as I do designing  
- I think good gameplay is **felt**, not explained
